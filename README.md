# Classes-and-Objects-
This repository contains the code which demonstrates the classes and objects in C++

In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), classes and objects form the foundation for representing real-world entities.

A class acts as a blueprint or template that defines the properties and behaviors of objects.

An object is a concrete instance of a class that holds actual data and can perform actions defined by the class.

A class in C++ is a user-defined data type that encapsulates data members (variables) and member functions (methods).

Data members → variables declared inside the class.

Member functions → functions defined inside the class to operate on its data.

When a class is declared, no memory is allocated. Memory is assigned only when objects are created from the class. Multiple objects can be created from the same class.

C++ also supports local classes, which are classes defined inside a function. Such classes are only accessible within that function.

Access Specifiers in C++:

Access specifiers define the visibility and accessibility of class members.

public → Members are accessible from outside the class.

private → Members are hidden and cannot be accessed from outside.

protected → Members are not accessible outside the class, but can be inherited by derived classes.

Implementation:

The concept of classes and objects is demonstrated using the following programs:

Displaying student information.

Displaying car information using classes and methods.

Implementing a calculator using classes.

Calculating the area of a rectangle.

Calculating the volume of a cuboid (demonstrating the use of private and public members).

Algorithms:
1. Student Information using Class and Objects

Start

Define a class Student with public data members:

name (string), branch (string), subject (string), year (string), result (float).

In main():

Create object s1 of class Student.

Assign values and display details.

Reassign values to s1 and display updated details.

End

2. Calculator using Class and Objects

Start

Define a class Calculator with public data members: a, b (operands), and result variables.

Define member functions:

input() → take input.

addition(), subtraction(), mult(), div1() → perform respective operations.

In main():

Create object c1.

Call all functions and display results.

End

3. Car Information using Class and Objects

Start

Define a class Car with public data members: car_brand, car_yr, car_model.

Define member function info() to input details.

In main():

Create object c1.

Call info() and display details.

End

4. Rectangle Area using Class and Objects

Start

Define a class rec_area with public members: length, breadth, area.

Define function area1() to input values and calculate area.

In main():

Create object r1.

Call area1() and display area.

End

5. Cuboid Volume using Class and Objects

Start

Define class cuboid with:

Private members: height = 10.0, width = 20.0, length = 45.0.

Public function volume() → return height * width * length.

In main():

Create object c1.

Call volume() and display result.

End

Conclusion:

The above programs demonstrate how classes and objects are used in C++ to represent data and behavior. They also illustrate the role of access specifiers (public and private) in controlling access to class members.
